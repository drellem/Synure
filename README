Example
========
(let (fac (lambda n
  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fac (- n 1))))))
  (fac 3)) 

=> 6.0

Features
============
*Note, this is a work in progress.
*+,-,/,* functions. These take exactly one argument.
*Lambdas. Lambdas takes exactly one argument which is not in parentheses.
*Currying. This uses an 'fn' syntax similar to the lambda form but with multiple arguments.
*Let expressions. These are equivalent to letrec by default.
*If expressions. These require expressions for both the 'if' and 'else' outcomes.
*Quotes. Both explicitly and with the ' operator.
*Semicolon comments.
*Top-level 'define' form.
*Top-level defn form.
*Macros with defmacro.

TODO (after basic features)
=========================
*Lazy interpreter
*Compiler to virtual stack machine (JVM?)
